Great question! Since you're at an **intermediate level**, here's a realistic, well-paced **7-day plan** to complete the **AI-Powered Resume Analyzer** project ‚Äî and still have time to polish and deploy it.

---

## üóìÔ∏è **7-Day Plan to Build Resume Analyzer**

### ‚úÖ **Day 1 ‚Äì Project Setup + Resume Parsing**

* Set up a GitHub repo with a proper `README.md`.
* Build a function to **upload and parse PDF/DOCX resumes** using `pdfminer`, `docx`, or `PyMuPDF`.
* Extract clean text from resumes.

**Goal**: Upload resume ‚Üí Extract text ‚Üí Print it to console.

---

### ‚úÖ **Day 2 ‚Äì Job Description Input + Text Cleaning**

* Create a simple UI (Streamlit or Flask) for:

  * Resume upload
  * Job description input
* Add **text preprocessing** functions:

  * Lowercase, remove stopwords, punctuation, etc.
  * Tokenize words

**Goal**: Cleaned text ready for analysis.

---

### ‚úÖ **Day 3 ‚Äì Skills & Keyword Extraction**

* Use libraries like `spaCy` or `NLTK` to extract:

  * Skills (use a skill keyword list or SkillNer)
  * Entities: experience, education, etc.
* Compare resume vs job description on:

  * Keywords matched
  * Skills missing

**Goal**: Generate a basic "match percentage" report.

---

### ‚úÖ **Day 4 ‚Äì Smart Suggestions with NLP**

* Add smart suggestions:

  * If a skill in JD is missing in resume ‚Üí suggest adding
  * If resume is too short ‚Üí suggest improvements
* Optionally: Use `sentence-transformers` (BERT) to compute semantic similarity between resume & JD.

**Goal**: Add AI-enhanced suggestions, skill matching.

---

### ‚úÖ **Day 5 ‚Äì Build Web UI (Streamlit)**

* Turn everything into a **nice interactive app**.
* Display:

  * Resume preview
  * Match % score
  * Keyword heatmap
  * Suggestions
* Allow download/save of the report (optional).

**Goal**: Fully working app with a clean UI.

---

### ‚úÖ **Day 6 ‚Äì Testing + Polish**

* Clean up the code (modularize).
* Add comments, docstrings, README instructions.
* Add a test resume + job description example.
* Test the app with multiple inputs.
* Add loading indicators, error handling.

**Goal**: Professional-quality project ready to deploy.

---

### ‚úÖ **Day 7 ‚Äì Deploy + Market**

* Deploy on:

  * **Streamlit Cloud** (easiest)
  * Or **Render.com / Vercel** (Flask)
* Record a 1-min **demo video** (Loom/OBS).
* Add a **LinkedIn post**: what you built, what tech you used, and how it helps people.
* Write a **blog (optional)** on Medium or Hashnode.

**Goal**: Project live + shared = recruiter-ready!

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time Needed Daily:

* **2‚Äì3 hours/day** should be enough.
* If you're faster or more experienced in one area (e.g., Streamlit), you can compress this to **4‚Äì5 days**.
